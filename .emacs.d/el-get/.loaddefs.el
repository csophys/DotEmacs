Major mode for editing Clojure code - similar to Lisp mode.

Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Toggle undo-tree mode.
With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
A positive prefix argument turns the mode on.
A negative prefix argument turns it off.

Undo-tree-mode replaces Emacs' standard undo feature with a more
powerful yet easier to use version, that treats the undo history
as what it is: a tree.

The following keys are available in `undo-tree-mode':

  \\{undo-tree-map}

Within the undo-tree visualizer, the following keys are available:

  \\{undo-tree-visualizer-map}

(defvar global-undo-tree-mode nil "\
Non-nil if Global-Undo-Tree mode is enabled.
See the command `global-undo-tree-mode' for a description of this minor mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
either customize it (see the info node `Easy Customization')
or call the function `global-undo-tree-mode'.")

(autoload 'global-undo-tree-mode "undo-tree/undo-tree" "\
Toggle Undo-Tree mode in all buffers.
With prefix ARG, enable Global-Undo-Tree mode if ARG is positive;
otherwise, disable it.  If called from Lisp, enable the mode if
ARG is omitted or nil.

Undo-Tree mode is enabled in all buffers where
`turn-on-undo-tree-mode' would do it.
See `undo-tree-mode' for more information on Undo-Tree mode.
